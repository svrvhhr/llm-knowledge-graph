Below is a list of entity names extracted from a knowledge graph. 
Some may refer to the same real-world entities but with different wording.

Please identify groups of entities that refer to the same concept, and provide a standardized name for each group.
Return your answer as a JSON object where the keys are the standardized names and the values are arrays of all variant names that should map to that standard name.
Only include entities that have multiple variants or need standardization.

Entity list:
{entity_list}

Format your response as valid JSON like this:
{{
  \"standardized name 1\": [\"variant 1\", \"variant 2\"],
  \"standardized name 2\": [\"variant 3\", \"variant 4\", \"variant 5\"]
}}
